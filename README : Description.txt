MaxiMichael - Billie Jean

///////////////////

DESCRIPTION:

Extending from week 4, where we used Maximilian, I wanted to push my abilities and create an entire track from scratch in C++. I chose billie jean by Michael Jackson for this project due to its recognisable bassline and synth part. 

The entire track is sequenced in C++ using Maximilian. Inspired by dubstep remixes such as CRAGGA's 'please mr postman", I wanted to include samples from the original track. I have sampled the Capella from YouTube and then applied effects in reason 12. 

The track begins with a nod to the original, with its rigid baseline and iconic synth part before becoming a rap/dubstep hybrid with vocal samples that compliment the synthesisers. As the track progresses there are multiple changes that are made to the drums and synths whether that be the rhythm, notes or effects.

I used multiple different sequencing techniques for each element in the track which can be seen through the functions I have created.

The track is roughly 1m 10s long although you can change the currentBar variable to start the track at a different place, this is what I used to adjust certain sections of the track in development.

REASONS FOR THE PROJECT:

I have experimented with audio libraries such as JUCE, tone.js and Maximilian throughout my time at goldsmiths, however I have never created or heard a structured track. I wanted to push the sequencing and synthesis elements as far as I could in order to create the illusion it was made in a DAW and not raw code. 

I realise that my project lacks a visual element and there are technical reasons for this. Originally, I wanted to create a silhouette of Michael Jackson that would dance to a basic version of the track. However, I had major issues with openFrameworks and ofMaxim. After trying for several days to make this work which included re-downloading all of these components(including Xcode) I could not get it to work. 
The errors I got when trying to create these projects were vague such as 'linker command exit - v1' and other similar errors that I could not fix and I have also tackled in other modules. I took a gamble and chose to continue with the development of the track and this is why I have focused on adding as many sonic changes as I could.


A NOTE TO MARKER:
Extending on this point, I hope that you can understand these issues and appreciate that I have used the time I would have spent on a visual element to create a structured track that, although short, contains multiple sections and changing parameters. 



////////////////////
CONCLUSION: I believe that my aims have been successful for the project. I have clearly created identifiable sections of the track; re-created the iconic bass, synth and guitar line, and added my own production style to the track.

HOWTO:
When loading the file you will need to include Maximillian. When creating the track I included the sample files and cpp file in the Maximilian download, this is because if I stored it in a separate folder it would not work. However,I am sure you will not have this issue.

I have included the sample files in the submission. In the setup function of the project, you may need to change the path to these files, although the names of the samples are self-explanatory and this should not take much time but will depend on your computer.
